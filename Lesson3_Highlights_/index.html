            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a type of system that keeps track of changes to file(s) over the course of the project. This is incredibly useful, as it will allow the user to go back and access previous versions of files without having to worry about what they would otherwise be writing over. A Version Control System (VCS) is a very important tool for people in digital professions, including graphic and web designers, as it allows the user to change files back to their prior versions, compare changes between versions, see who last modified the project/who caused an issue, or even revert the entire project to a previous version.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Cloud9 is what is referred to as a local repository, where all of your files are hosted. It is where the user edits the files before they are pushed onto the remote repository. For the purposes of this class, the remote repository will be GitHub. Remote repositories are especially useful for version control, as they will never overwrite a file, they save multiple versions of each file. There are three primary git commands that can send your files from local to remote repositories. The first two are “git add.” and “git commit –m ‘string’” which are both associated with your local repository. The third is “git push” which will push the files to your remote repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Getting a Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The first main way to get a Git project is taking an existing project or directory and importing it into Git. To start, you need to go the directory of the project and type "$ git init" which will create a new subdirectory named .git that contains all necessary repository files. To start version-controlling the existing files you can enter these three commands into the directory: "$ git add *.c" followed by "$ git add LICENSE" and finally "$ git commit -m 'initial project version'". The other main way to get a git project is to clone an existing Git repository. The command to do this is simply "git clone [url]". Instead of just getting a working copy, Git recieves a full copy of nearly all data that the server has. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Recording Changes to the Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">With a Git repository, users will be able to make various changes to a project, as well as committing snapshots of those changes into your repository each time the project reaches a state you want to record. This is the defining feature of version control systems, the ability to take save the versions of your project at various points. Each file in your working directory can be in two states, either tracked or untracked. Tracked files are the files that were in the most recent snapshot and can be unmodified, modified, or staged. Untracked files are all of the other files, the ones in your working directory that weren’t in the last snapshot or in the working area. When a user edits files, Git sees them as modified, which you then stage and commit your changes.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Alternative Version-Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">While GitHub is currently very popular, there are older version control systems that are somewhat easier to use. CVS is often considered the precursor to modern revision control systems. It was originally released in 1986, and Google Code still hosts the original Usenet post announcing CVS. 
Subversion, or SVN, is most likely the version control system with the widest adoption. Most open-source projects use Subversion as a repository because other larger projects, such as SourceForge, Apache, Python, Ruby and many others, use it as well. Google Code uses Subversion exclusively to distribute code.
The learning curves for both of these Version Control systems are not too steep, and they’re very simple systems for making sure files and revisions are kept up to date.
